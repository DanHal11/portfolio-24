                <p>I know the idea of my project changed from what I initially wanted it to be but I generally wanted it to be based on this video game I'm absolutely in love with called Control. I put a link right below that explains the absolutely immense and massive story surrounding this wonderful game. If you don't want to watch, Control is basically about a secretive government agency called the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) that is in charge of overseeing AWE's (Altered World Events) or just really paranormal shit that can cause damage to reality.<a href="link" target="_blank"></a></p>

                <p>My project will be a site made by a government whistleblower that works under a secretive government agency, exposing that the people he works under are planning to end the world as we know it.</p>
