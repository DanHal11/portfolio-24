                <p>By making the film “about” something other than what it’s really about. Which is what mythology is, and what storytelling has always been about. Art is about communicating with people emotionally without the intellectual artifacts of the current situation, and dealing with very emotional issues. Life and death, or “I really want to kill my father and have sex with my mother.” It’s hard to talk about that kind of thing in a family situation without somebody getting upset. But in art, you can deal with those issues. You begin to realize that other people have had the same experience or go down those same paths deep in their minds. Most stories are really told for adolescents, which is why Star Wars was aimed at adolescents. Societies have a whole series of stories to bring adolescents into adulthood by saying, “Don’t worry, everybody thinks that way. You’re just part of the community. We don’t quite talk about it, but if you act on some of your notions, here’s what will happen: Zeus will reach down and smash you flat like a bug or the entire Greek army will come and crush your city and burn everybody inside of it, including your heroes.” These lessons are continually handed down from generation to generation. I love history, so I create an environment — in the past, present, or future — that allows me to tell the story, but in a way that’s not incendiary. </p>

                <p>I think George Lucas hits the nail on the head here. A lot of stories told in fiction today don’t understand subtlety or metaphors, especially not at the level writers like George Lucas did. Real and realistic problems don’t require realistic scenarios to address, many of the best social and societal commentaries have come from pieces of complete fiction. I also like that he explains that a story can be serious and still for kids. There’s no need to dilute children's entertainment or treat them like they’re stupid. The line between kids entertainment and “real” entertainment that adults can enjoy shouldn’t be as defined or aggressive as it is right now.
